# Global-Superstore-Analysis-Via-Python
Analyzed the data for 24 columns and 51290 rows via Python libraries.  Made some manipulation. I extracted a new columns(Day, Month) from Order Date column. Moreover, I made price column by dividing Sale from Quantity columns.  Asked questions to get a clear data. Finally, I created a tool to know the relation between three variables (multiple axis). we can see that the office supplies had the highest quantity of order because it had the lowest price.
